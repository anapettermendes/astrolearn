    <div class="box"><p class="bold">OUR MISSION</p>
      <p>Our aim on Astro-Learn is to educate Key Stage 2 children about space. We want to help them develop a better understanding through graphical learning to make it more fun and interactive.
         Our objective is to engage the students in a unique fun way to make them interested in space and the learning material. They help with concentration, identifying gaps in knowledge,
         building confidence and help children retain information.
         Most importantly - theyâ€™re fun! </p>

   <div class="box"><p class="bold">ABOUT US</p>
   <p>Just over a year ago in late 2019 the world was hit with a global pandemic that affected our whole lives including education. Now in 2021 we have launched Astro- Learn.
      With hundreds of websites about space only a handful of them aimed at KS2 children only. We wanted to build the closest thing to being in school so children will not have
      to fall behind or miss out on anything while being stuck at home. </p>
