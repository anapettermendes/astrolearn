	<h5> SPACE TECH </h5>
	<p class="p"> The solar system is made up of the sun, stars and planets which are all bound together though gravity. It is the gravitationally bound system that contains objects which orbit the sun. <br>The largest objects are the 8 planets, the rest are dwarf planets and small solar system bodies. Solar system has been around for <b>4.568 billion years old</b>. The system was created when gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud occurred 4.6 billion years ago. The planets starting nearest to the sun are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus.
	The majority of the mass from the system is in the Sun and the rest is contained in Jupiter.

				<div> <p class="sun_headings"> HOW TO SURVIVE IN SPACE </p> As you may know, there is a special force within the Earths atmosphere called <b>Gravity</b>. <br><br> There is no Gravity in Space which means there are special methods in which we must adapt to. <br> Doing this, will allow us to stay safe in Space. Not only is there no Gravity in Space, but Astronauts are also exposed to <b>cosmic rays</b> due to not having the protection of Earth’s atmosphere. This can increase their chances of getting diseases. <br>
				<b>Exercising</b> is one of the most important parts of adapting to life in Space. Although the muscles in the human body are able to be more relaxed, it can cause problems with bones weakening. <br>There is also the risk of heart muscles becoming weaker due to less blood flow. <br> Did you know that it is known for you to grow a few centimetres whilst being in Space!

			<div class="p"> <p class="sun_headings">SPACE SUIT</p> All of the elements of the Spacesuit include cooling garment, hard upper torso, gloves, lower torse, layers, life support system, communication systems and a helmet.
			The purpose of the <b>cooling garment</b> is to ensure that the astronauts have regulated body temperature. The <b>Hard Upper Torso</b> is what connects the suit with the portable life support system. Features such as <b>gloves, lower Torso, waist bearing, bladder</b> are designed for the astronaut use move as easy as possible. The <b>communication system</b> located in the helmet, it contains earphones, microphones so that the astronaut can communicate with others.
			The <b>helmet</b> serves as a pressure bubble which is made of very strong plastic, a special gold coating for the sun and <b>a protective visor</b> on the outside to stop pressure bubbles. They must be wearing the full suit for whenever they leave the international space center.

				<div> <p class="sun_headings">SHUTTLE</p> Mars is around 142 Million miles away from the Sun. It is the 4th planet from the Sun. <br> It orbits the sun at an average speed of 14.5 miles per second.
				Its diameter is around 4,220 miles and its tilt of axis is 25 degrees.
				The average temperature is around -81 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmosphere is made up of mostly carbon dioxide and water vapor.
				</div>

				<div> <p class="sun_headings">MOON CAR</p> The name of the car which has been driven on the moon is called Lunar Roving Vehicle. It is a battery-operated car which has been used the past three missions to the Moon. It can carry up to 490kg including two astronauts, all of the necessary equipment and what’s knowns as Lunar samples. The speed it can get to be around 8 miles per hour.
				</div>

					<div> <p class="sun_headings">ROCKETS</p> A rocket is an object which can get through the Earth’s atmosphere. Although we mainly think of a Rocket as way to get space, it can also be an engine. In order for Rockets to work, they burn fuel which is then turned to hot gas. In order for the rocket to move, the fuel is pushed downward causing the rocket to move in the opposite direction.

				<div> <p class="sun_headings">ROBONAUT</p> Robonaut is a humanoid robot torso on the ISS (international Space Station) that looks like, well, half an astronaut. The similarities are purposeful: His humanlike arms and hands allow him to operate the same tools the real astronauts use. Robonaut can be controlled by engineers back on Earth or by an ISS crewmember wearing a specialized 3D visor, vest, and gloves. Recently, Robonaut received a set of legs, which will allow it to do even more, including space walks.

				<div> <p class="sun_headings">SATELLITES</p> A satellite is a moon, planet or machine which orbits a star or planet. Earth is a satellite due it orbiting the Sun. We have satellites orbiting Earth, a natural one being the Moon and the machine ones are there for different roles. Some are to take pictures of other planets, the sun, and black holes. Some may even have the job of faraway galaxies. All of these help scientists understand our solar system better.

					<div> <p class="sun_headings">HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE</p> The Hubble telescope was launch ed in 1990 and has changed our understanding of the Universe. It is the largest telescope in space, it is located above the clouds, pollution and atmosphere giving it the perfect view of the Universe. The telescope has been updated at least five times resulting in brand new information and sights. It has made over 1.4 million observations over its lifetime and is the reason for many discoveries such as seeing a comet collide with Jupiter.
