    <h5> The Universe </h5>
    <p class="p"> The solar system is made up the sun, stars and planets which are bound together though gravity. It is a gravitationally bound system that contains objects which orbit the sun. <br>The largest objects are the 8 planets, the rest are dwarf planets and small solar system bodies. Solar system has been around for <b>4.568 billion years old</b>. The system was created when gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud occurred 4.6 billion years ago. The planets starting nearest to the sun are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus.
    The majority of the mass from the system is in the Sun and the rest is contained in Jupiter.

        <div class="text">A black hole can occur when a star dies causing gravity to pull to the point light can’t even escape.The reason they are called black holes is due to the light being trapped and unable to see by the human eye.<br>The only way to see a black hole is through special telescopes and tools which allows us to differentiate between the behaviour of stars close to the black hole compared to the stars that are further away.<br>They can be big or small in size Scientist believe the smallest holes can be the size of an atom but have the mass of a large mountain.<br>Another kind of black holes are known as “Stellar”.<br>Scientists believe that the smallest black holes were formed way back when the universe began.<br> A black hole can be identified by the gases that surrounds it.

It has many satellites and is with other galaxies which is known as the Virgo Supercluster. <br> The Milky Way is the second largest within the Universe (after Andromeda). It is approximately 890 billion to 1.54 trillion times mass of the Sun. it is unknown how many exactly, however the Milky way could contain 10 billion white dwarfs, a billion neutron stars and hundred million stellar holes. <br> It has been estimated that it holds and contains 100-400 billion stars and a number of Planets, many of which are already part of out Solar System.

        <div class="text">Stars are born from the clouds of dust which has been scattered throughout most of the galaxies. They have the important job of distributing heavy substances and elements such as carbon, nitrogen and oxygen.<br>When there is some sort of turbulence or disturbance, the gas and dust begins to collapse under its own form of gravitational pull. When this is happening, the center begins to heat up which is known as a protostar. This will then become a day star one day.<br>A star would need to be about 50 million years old and would need to collapse from the beginning to adulthood in order to become the size of the Sun. Generally speaking, a large star would have a shorter life expectancy, although in some cases they can live for billions of years. </div>

       <div class="text">An interstellar is where the Suns constant flow of materials and magnetic field stop affecting its surroundings. This is called a heliosphere. This is created when the Sun sends particles around space over 670,000 miles per hour through a solar wind. As we know, all stars being their lives from fallen material from a giant molecular cloud. When a cloud full of molecular gas and dust are caught in turbulence, it causes knots and fall under its own gravitational pull. The material in the center of this then heats up and creates a protostar which then evolves into a star. This is stellar evolution. </div>

        There may be life on Mars. This is because in 1986, NASA found something that represented a fossil of living things from a rock they recovered from Mars.
        Nobody knows how many starts are in Space. There are so many different stars in our galaxy that astronomers know about, however there are billions of galaxies so knowing the exact amount is close to impossible. A neutron star can spin up to 600 times per day after its born from a collapsed supernova.
        The footsteps on the moon could last around 100 million years due to not having its own atmosphere to erode the surface.

When it comes near to the end of its nuclear burning stage, it will expel most of its outer material. This then creates a planetary nebula. The hot core of the star remains. This then becomes very hot and turns into a white dwarf. The temperate can get to 100,000 kelvins. It takes the white dwarf around billion years.
           The typical size of a white dwarf is half the size of the Sun yet still bigger than Earth.

The body of the moon is cratered and pitted from impacts such as asteroids etc. Earth’s moon is the 5th largest out over 190 different moons which orbit the other planets. The rotation of the Moon and Earth are in sync. The Moons presence, helps stabilize Earth’s wobble which is what helps stabilize the climate. <br> The atmosphere of the Moon is extremely thin which is called an exosphere. You wouldn’t be able to breath without a spacesuit. It has a weak atmosphere and has no water or liquid, which means it cannot support any life.The distance of the Moon to Earth is around 240,000 miles<br> The moon is the largest and brightest form of light we have at night. There is a robotic spacecraft on the moon currently which is exploring new facts about our moon.</div>

    <div class="overlay2">
    <div class="text">A super Nova is a star that is exploding and blasts part of the star into space.
     A supernova happens when there is a change in a star core or center. <br> There are two types of supernovas, it can happen in a binary star system or at the end of a single star’s lifetime. Binary stars are when two stars orbit the same point. One of the stars is a carbon-oxygen white dwarf and steals matter from the other star. Eventually, there’s too much matter that is collected by both stars and causes the star to explode. When the lifeline ends and the star runs out of nuclear fuel, the overspill of mass runs to its core. This is then too heavy and causes the core to collapse and results in a giant explosion of a supernova. <br> A supernova will burn out over a short period of time but tell scientists a lot about the universe. They have shown how the universe is expanding. We can look for supernovas through telescopes and special tools which allow us to observe the visible light form the explosion.

    <div class="overlay">
    <div class="text">The universe was formed as a result of the Big Bang. It was composed from radiation and subatomic particles. There are many theories to say that the tiny particles merged together and formed to make starts, clusters of stars and eventually they made galaxies.<br> The shapes of the galaxies are typically influenced from other galaxies. They often collide with their neighbours and the Milky way itself is on course to collide with the nearest galaxy Andromeda.<br>More than two-thirds of the known galaxies have a spiral shape, this is the same for our galaxy (the Milky Way).
